# Cross-Space Adaptive Filter: Integrating Graph Topology and Node Attributes for Alleviating the Over-smoothing Problem
> **Contact**: Chen Huang 

A cross-space filter is proposed to produce the adaptive-frequency information extracted from both the topology and attribute spaces. It alleviates the over-smoothing problem while simultaneously promoting the effectiveness of downstream tasks.
